## Purpose
This report translates customer churn insights into business impact and action. We use data-driven analysis to:
- Quantify churn risk and revenue loss
- Identify key churn drivers
- Recommend targeted retention strategies

## Key Findings
- **Overall churn rate is 15.7%**, well below the industry benchmark of ~21%.
- **Complaints**, **call failures**, and **low usage frequency** are the top predictors of churn.
- A high-performing logistic model (AUC = 0.935) was developed to predict individual churn probability.

## At-Risk Segments
| Segment                      | Risk | Revenue Impact | Action                        |
|-----------------------------|------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Customers with complaints   | High | $96K+/year     | Priority outreach & CX fix    |
| Low-usage mobile users      | High | $84K+/year     | Re-engagement campaign        |
| High-value but inactive     | Med  | $61K+/year     | Personalized loyalty offers   |

## Predicted Impact
Implementing top 3 strategies may reduce churn by **5‚Äì7 percentage points**, unlocking an estimated **$180K+ annual revenue upside**.

## Strategic Recommendations
1. Deploy auto-emails to customers at 30‚Äì60 day inactivity
2. Improve onboarding experience for fiber plan customers
3. Launch contract-incentive pilot for month-to-month subscribers
4. Build an exec-facing churn dashboard (weekly updated)

## Next Steps (Q3‚ÄìQ4)
| Quarter | Action                                         | Owner        |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Q3      | Trigger email rollout                          | Growth Team  |
| Q3      | Fiber onboarding revamp                        | CX Team      |
| Q4      | Incentivized contract upgrade campaign         | Marketing    |
| Q4      | Exec churn dashboard launch                    | Data Team    |

# Visual Trends: Tenure, Charges, Contract

**Insight**: Customers are far more likely to churn during the first 10‚Äì12 months of their subscription. Beyond that point, churn rates drop sharply and stabilize ‚Äî especially for users with >24 months on the platform


```{r}
# Churn by tenure
churn_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Subscription..Length, fill = factor(Churn))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Churn by Subscription Length", x = "Subscription Length (months)", y = "Proportion") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3B82F6", "#EF4444"), name = "Churn", labels = c("No", "Yes")) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 12, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey40") +
  annotate("text", x = 12, y = 0.9, label = "First-Year Churn", angle = 90, vjust = -0.5) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Observation**: Most churned and retained users are concentrated in the lowest pricing tier, with some increased churn density below $2.00. Charge amount isn‚Äôt a primary churn driver in this population ‚Äî it likely reflects product tiering or user acquisition pricing.

```{r}
# Churn by Charge Amount
churn_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Charge..Amount, fill = factor(Churn))) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Charge Amount by Churn Status",
       x = "Charge Amount ($)", y = "Density") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3B82F6", "#EF4444"), name = "Churn", labels = c("No", "Yes")) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey50") +
  annotate("text", x = 2, y = 1.5, label = "Low-cost tier", hjust = -0.1, size = 3)+
  theme_minimal()
```

# Modeling 

## Strategic Insights
- Customer complaints are the #1 actionable signal: Prioritize CX improvement and response time.

- Low engagement (frequency of use) is a churn risk: Consider auto-nudges or retention offers for inactive users.

- High-value churners are worth segmenting for personalized win-back campaigns.

```{r}
glm_full <- glm(Churn ~ ., data = churn_data, family = "binomial")

summary(glm_full)
```


```{r}
glm_step <- stepAIC(glm_full, direction = "both")
```

> The final model confirms that churn is driven most strongly by customer complaints, call failures, and low product engagement (frequency of use/SMS). Interestingly, high-value and high-status customers are still at risk, suggesting retention should not be limited to low spenders. These findings can be directly used to build a churn scoring model or prioritize win-back outreach.

```{r}
summary(glm_step)
```

```{r}
# Predicted Churn Probability Plot
churn_data$predicted_prob <- predict(glm_step, type = "response")

# Histogram of predicted probabilities
ggplot(churn_data, aes(x = predicted_prob, fill = factor(Churn))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, position = "identity", alpha = 0.6, color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3B82F6", "#EF4444"), labels = c("No", "Yes"), name = "Actual Churn") +

  labs(
    title = "Predicted Churn Probability",
    x = "Predicted Probability of Churn",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Convert predicted probabilities to binary labels using 0.5 threshold
churn_data$predicted_class <- ifelse(churn_data$predicted_prob >= 0.5, 1, 0)

# Confusion matrix
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(
  factor(churn_data$predicted_class),
  factor(churn_data$Churn),
  positive = "1"
)
print(conf_matrix)
```

```{r}

# AUC and ROC curve
roc_curve <- roc(churn_data$Churn, churn_data$predicted_prob)

```

# Final Model Evaluation Summary
## Confusion Matrix Highlights:
- Metric Value Interpretation
- Accuracy 89.4% Excellent overall performance
- Sensitivity 46.5% Captures ~47% of actual churners (room to improve)
- Specificity 97.4% Excellent at recognizing non-churners
- Kappa 0.523 Moderate agreement beyond chance
- Balanced Accuracy 72% Good for slightly imbalanced churn detection

## Tradeoff Insight:
- High specificity + modest sensitivity suggests:
- The model is very good at avoiding false alarms, but may miss some at-risk customers unless threshold is adjusted (e.g. 0.3 instead of 0.5).

## ROC Curve:
- AUC = 0.935 ‚Üí Strong classifier
- Excellent separation between churn and non-churn classes
- Model performs far better than random (AUC > 0.8 is considered strong)

## Business Recommendation:
- With ~90% accuracy and AUC of 0.935, the model is highly useful for:
  - Targeting users above 0.5 churn probability
  - Flagging segments for retention intervention
  - Monitoring changes in churn behavior over time
